# Pseudoprime-Generator
A c++ program to find pseudoprime numbers which are common to several bases. For theory on strong pseudoprimes Wikipedia and Google are a better source, this is just an implementation of the definition. The working of the program has been explained in the program itself using comments (see the cpp file for details). This program is part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course project at VIT Chennai.

## Advantage
The program has implementation of a new algorithm for finding (2^n)%a which takes care of very large values of n and a. Contact me for more details on the working of the algorithm.

## Limitations
Implementation of basic definition, no new algorithm for finding strong pseudoprimes
