# Pseudoprime-Generator
A c++ program to find pseudoprime numbers which are common to several bases. The working of the program has been explained in the program itself using comments (see the cpp file for details). For theory on strong pseudo primes google is a better source. This program is part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course project at VIT Chennai.
